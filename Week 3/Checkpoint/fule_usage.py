Purpose: Many vehicle owners record the fuel efficiency of their vehicles as a
way to track the health of the vehicle. If the fuel efficiency of a vehicle
suddenly drops, there is probably something wrong with the engine or drive 
train of the vehicle. In the United States, fuel efficiency for gasoline 
powered vehicles is calculated as miles per gallon. In most other countries, 
fuel efficiency is calculated as liters per 100 kilometers.

The formula for computing fuel efficiency in miles per gallon is the following:

mpg = 
end âˆ’ start
gallons
where start and end are both odometer values in miles and gallons is a fuel 
amount in U.S. gallons.

The formula for converting miles per gallon to liters per 100 kilometers 
is the following:

lp100k = 
235.215/mpg
